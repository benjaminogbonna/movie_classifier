- `movieclassifier/`: The movie classifier embedded in a web application with update from sqlite database upon start


To run the web applications locally, `cd` into the respective directory (as listed above) and execute the main-application script, for example,

    cd ./movieclassifier
    python3 app.py

Now, you should see something like

     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
     * Restarting with reloader

in your terminal.
Next, open a web browser and enter the address displayed in your terminal (typically http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to view the web application.
